             <img id=m1 src="d2.jpeg" alt="">
              <p>In our toddler and preschool classrooms we make sure to balance quiet and active times. Young children’s attention spans are shorter and their bodies just want to move. In addition to recess, we make sure to provide music and movement activities for our preschoolers. As I’ve shared in my preschool schedule post, our designated music and movement time is after snack. However, we’ve also used instruments in the gym during indoor recess and at other times in the day when we could see that the children just wanted to move.</p></div>

               <h3>Writing</h3>
               <img id=m2 src="d5.jpeg" alt="">
                 <p>Your preschooler will love learning to write with these engaging and creative preschool writing activities. It all starts with pencil grasp development, so learning writing skills doesn't have to be traditional. Using materials from any home or classroom, these activities are easy to follow and memorable. Once you've mastered these, try preschool reading activities.</p>

                 <p>Not only is dancing fun for young kids, but it can improve their physical health and boost their social skills, communication skills, and self-esteem. What’s more, teaching your kids how to do these dances—and possibly doing the dance with them—is sure to make for lots of laughs and fun! Here are five easy dances and dance games to teach your child. </p></div>

        <h3>Future students</h3>
          <p>Ready to Enroll?</p>
           <p>If you’ve already visited a school and want to enroll, all you need is in our Enrollment Packet. Get a checklist of what to bring, along with the forms you need to get started. Download, print, and complete the packet for your next visit.</p>

        <h3>Current Students</h3>
           <p>Social skills-Daycare offers children of all ages an opportunity to interact with peers who are not their siblings or family, often for the very first time. Without parents to guide them through the interaction—though with adult supervision to ensure the children get along—kids learn how to play, share, and learn together on their own, much like how they will be expected to do in school. </p>
           <p>Friendships-The other kids that your child meets in daycare are from the same area and often from the same neighborhood. Likely, they will attend the same schools. The friendships that your child forges in daycare will not only be his or her first friends, but may also be best friends they will keep for a lifetime.</p>
             <p>Separation Anxiety-Some children are not faced with leaving their parents until kindergarten, resulting in a tearful and sudden separation at the school doors. By being slowly introduced to a new environment away from home, new adults, and their peers, children learn sooner that being away from home isn’t scary.</p>     
         <h3>Alumni</h3>
        <p> Academic advancement-
         Various scientific studies have shown that kids who spend time in high quality daycare as young children had higher cognitive performance as teens. According to these studies, sending your kids to a daycare can contribute to their future success. This is true for daycare settings with facilities that provide adequate support and plenty of opportunities for extensive interaction with care providers and peers.</p>
         
        <p> Increased confidence-
         Sending your child  to a daycare teaches them to feel confident and comfortable in social settings. This is something that could benefit them throughout their lives especially when they meet new people. Learning valuable interpersonal skills at a young age helps kids practice their communication skills and build their self-esteem.</p> 
         
        <p>Communication
         Because a daycare environment includes other children of different ages and stages, it is an excellent venue for your child to learn how to communicate effectively. Some kids are talkative and chatty, while some others are comfortable communicating non-verbally. Regardless of the communication patterns, it is a perfect opportunity for your child to work on the areas of communication that they are having difficulties with. Care providers at our Jackson daycare are trained to help your toddler  build their confidence and articulation.</p> 

        <p> Smoother transition into kindergarten-
Children enrolled in a quality daycare find it easier to transition to the structured environment of kindergarten. Teachers and care providers in daycare centers use play and other engaging activities to introduce the fundamental concepts of alphabets and numbers. This will help your child to adjust to their formal schooling.</p>
